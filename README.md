A Self-Made Text Encryptor Application with JavaFX

There is a GUI available.
The Code is totally open source, so you can download it and use it in your own fashion !

I have also made a mobile app based on this code, please check it out : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MyKlty5AvtrEft4l7EvBdbKKoGuWJ3Z6/view?usp=sharing
